# IC-DESIGN Repository

Welcome to my Verilog circuits repository! This collection is organized into three main folders, each serving a distinct purpose in my learning and development journey in digital logic and hardware design.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `basic_blocks/`  
  Contains foundational Verilog modules such as multiplexers, decoders, flip-flops, counters, and other essential building blocks. Each module is designed for clarity and reusability.

- `projects/`  
  Includes more advanced or complete Verilog-based projects. These may integrate multiple basic blocks and demonstrate practical applications of digital design concepts.

- `kareem_waseem_assignments/`  
  A dedicated folder for homework assignments and exercises related to Kareem Wassem's coursework. These files reflect my progress and understanding of key topics.
